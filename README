NAME
    DBIx::DisconnectAll - disconnect all databases

SYNOPSIS
      use DBIx::DisconnectAll;

      dbi_disconnect_all();

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::DisconnectAll is utility module to disconnect all connected
    databases

    DBI has DBI->disconnect_all methods, but some DBD modules does not
    support it, so DBI->disconnect_all is undocumented yet and unusable.

    DBIx::DisconnectAll realizes disconnect_all from DBI's public API.
